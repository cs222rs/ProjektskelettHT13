        <h2>Welcome to the unnamed RPG system page.</h2>
            <p>This site is will be used in an effort to finish the roleplaying game I have been on and off working on for ages it seems. By making this I hope to have a place to gather everything under one roof so to say and perhaps in some way act as reminder to actually get some writing done.</p>
