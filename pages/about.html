            <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>I created this site to keep track of and organize the work on my own, yet to be named, RPG system. As I write more on this I will update this.It is very much a work in progress</p>
            <h2>Who?</h2>        
                <p>My name is Claes and I have been playing RPG´s for almost 25 years now. There have ofcourse been periods of more and less roleplaying in my life but that is just how it is.</p>
            <h2>What?</h2>
                <p>The game I am working on has gone through several changes so far but the main focus has remained the same. A game that focuses on survival and promotes teamwork without just making encounters tougher. I want a system that makes conflicts more tactial and dangerous. The players should consider hostilities as a last resource unless they have a superior advantage or no other option. I also want resource gathering and usage to be a big part of the game.</p>
