            <h2>Character Creation</h2>
            <h3>ATTRIBUTES</h3>
                <p>In the game there are 9 attributes. These attributes are Strength,Toughness, and Nimbleness. These are the physical attributes. Luck, Charisma and Command are known as the social attributes. And Wits, Intelligence and willpower are the intellectual attributes.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strength: The brute force and the application thereof.</li>
                    <li>Toughness: When the world knocks you around, it is this that keeps you standing.</li>
                    <li>Nimbleness: If you have the desire to put your legs behind your head this is for you.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Luck: Sometimes it is better to be lucky then good.</li>
                    <li>Charisma: Be it beauty or a pleasant personality.</li>
                    <li>Command: Some people just have that ability to lead.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Willpower: Stubbornness can take you farther then you otherwise might have gotten.</li>
                    <li>Intelligence: The pure logic power of the brain.</li>
                    <li>Wits: Your brain might wear the equivalent of clogs or running shoes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All these attributes will have a value between 0 and 5, where the higher the number the better your attribute is. The average attribute of a human is 2.</p>
                <ol start="0">
                    <li>Intelligence: You are even dumber then a brick. The fact that you do things is a constant source of amazement to everyone.</li>
                    <li>Nimbleness: If you really make an effort you might bend down far enough that you can see how someone could possibly reach their toes.</li>
                    <li>Strength: Pretty average. Carrying a moving box of books is possible but tiring.</li>
                    <li>Charisma: You have no trouble making friends.</li>
                    <li>Willpower: Marathon runners and long distance racers.</li>
                    <li>Wits: Sometimes you answer questions before they are even thought out.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Secondary attributes:</h3>
                <p>Health: Health always start at a value of 10, although some perks or flaws may alter that. Your characters health may raise and fall during the course of the game due to injuries and healing</p>
            <h3>Skills:</h3>
                <p>Like attributes, skills are in values from 0 to 5. Some of the kills can be used even with a 0 value and they are called Basic skills. Opposite those are the Advanced skills that can not be used with no value. They simply require training in them to be of any use.</p>
