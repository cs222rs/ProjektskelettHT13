            <h2>Setting</h2>
                <p>The setting is still in a very unpolished state</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Imagine our world in the not too far future. The world is overcrowded and earths resources are quickly running out. Fossile fuels are almost gone, waterlevels in the worlds oceans have risen, and tension between nations are running high.There is basicly a cold war on multiple fronts. Noone dares to make the first move unless they have sufficient firepower. Then scientists discover vast amounts of "yet to be named" raw material on "yet to be named planet". All the wealthiest nations race to take control of these materials as it will be enough to tip the scales.</p>
                <p>Since the need for manpower on these off-earth locations rise, and because of the high level of danger and discomfort during journey, as well as living and working on a distant world, several nations decide to use the vast amounts of convicts as a cheap and expendable workforce. Some nations used them as something more akin to slavelabor, while others offered reduced sentences for volontary participation. Every colony kept a sizable garrison of troops on site as well both for guarding prisoners and aainst sabotage from the other nations.</p>
                <p>So these mining colonies expanded and grew as more and more minerals were dug out of the planet. But they were never quite able to make them self-sustainable. Things like food and technology were transported too the sites and minerals away from them. The one day without warning the supply and cargo ships stopped as well as all transmissions from earth. </p>
            <h3>Life on (yet unnamed planet)</h3>
                <p>Life for both prisoners and guards is a harsh one. Even before all contact with earth ended. Many prisons actually introduced a primitive credit system. The more you work the better food you get or in some cases the ability to pay off your sentence earned credits. Ofcourse this quickly got exploited by the black market trade. A black market that now have become all but necessary to maintain life. Oxygen is maintained by large farms who now also serve as the main source of food but it is never enough to keep everyone fully fed. Water is recycled and cleaned over and over again. In some places there have been reports of cannibalism.</p>
